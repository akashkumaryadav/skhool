/*
  If your code editor displays a warning like "Unknown at rule @tailwindcss" for the directives above,
  it's commonly an issue with the editor's linter or CSS validation not fully recognizing
  Tailwind-specific syntax out-of-the-box.

  Ensure you have the official "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" extension (or equivalent for your editor)
  installed and enabled. This usually resolves such warnings.

  These directives are standard and correct for Tailwind CSS and will be processed
  properly by Next.js and PostCSS during the build.
